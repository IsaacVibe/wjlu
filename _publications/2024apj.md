excerpt: '**Abstract**: No radio pulsation was detected during the quiescent state of these peculiar subgroups of neutron stars. Any detection or non-detection provided by the most sensitive single dish will place the very constraints on the radiation mechanism of these compact objects. <br>
  **Conclusion**: We performed a series of tracking observations during the share-risk commensal phase of FAST, which places the most stringent constraints on the radio flux of magnetars and CCOs. The results indicate that these neutron stars are likely to be intrinsically radio-quiet or unluckily beamed.'
