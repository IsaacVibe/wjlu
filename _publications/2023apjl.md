excerpt: '**Abstract**: FRB 20201124A was observed to show significant RM variation in several weeks. We figured out the temporal variation of depolarization of FRB 20201124A from FAST observations in 2021. <br> **Conclusion**: The quasi-simultaneous variation of depolarization, RM variation, and the line-of-sight magnetic field of FRB 20201124A is consistent with the binary system scenario, which involves active stellar interactions.
