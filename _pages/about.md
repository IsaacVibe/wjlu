I am a PhD student in the Interstellar Medium and Star formation Group of National Astronomical Observatories of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. 
My research interests include Time-domain Astronomy, Fast Radio Bursts, and pulsars. 
I am also interested in the use of machine learning and data science to improve our understanding of the universe.

Research Experience
------
- <span style="font-family: Economica; font-size:2em;color:#EC1B26">Probing the Local Environments of Fast Radio Bursts</span>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><em>"A continuous work after the depolarization study"</em> </div><br>
  **Abstract**: Conjugate investigation on several repeating FRBs about their depolarization, temporal evolution, and Rotation Measure evolution.<br>
  **Conclusion**: _Parsec-scale_ distance between the foreground plasma screen and the FRB source has been revealed, implying that some of the FRBs are consistent with the supernovae explosion scenario while others favor compact interactions in the binary systems.<br>
- <span style="font-family: Economica; font-size:2em;color:#EDAB1F">Temporal Evolution of Depolarization and Magnetic Field of Fast Radio Burst 20201124A</span><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><em>"Bachelor Thesis"</em> </div><br>
  **Abstract**: FRB 20201124A was observed to show significant RM variation in several weeks. We figured out the temporal variation of depolarization of FRB 20201124A from FAST observations in 2021. <br>
  **Conclusion**: The quasi-simultaneous variation of depolarization, RM variation, and the line-of-sight magnetic field of FRB 20201124A is consistent with the binary system scenario, which involves active stellar interactions.

- <span style="font-family: Economica; font-size:2em;color:#60047a">Observations on several **magnetars** and a **central compact object** (CCO) at their quiescence using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope </span> ([FAST](https://fast.bao.ac.cn/)<img src="/image/FAST.jpg" alt="FAST icon" style="width: auto; height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;">)
  <div style="text-align: center;"><em>"Early-bird Scientific Research Training Program"</em> in NJU-Astro</div>
  - Collaborators: **Ping Zhou**, **Pei Wang**<br>
  **Abstract**: No radio pulsation was detected during the quiescent state of these peculiar subgroups of neutron stars. Any detection or non-detection provided by the most sensitive single dish will place the very constraints on the radiation mechanism of these compact objects. <br>
  **Conclusion**: We performed a series of tracking observations during the share-risk commensal phase of FAST, which places the most stringent constraints on the radio flux of magnetars and CCOs. The results indicate that these neutron stars are likely to be intrinsically radio-quiet or unluckily beamed.<br>

About Me
------
- I am usually an _ENFP_ and always enthusiastic about making friends and getting connections with people.<br>
- I am also a fan of food and music. Not being able to cook makes me a foodie who explores domestic and exotic cuisines. :drooling_face:
