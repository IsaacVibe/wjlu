I am a PhD student in the Interstellar Medium and Star formation Group of National Astronomical Observatories of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. 
My research interests include Time-domain Astronomy, Fast Radio Bursts, and pulsars. 
I am also interested in the use of machine learning and data science to improve our understanding of the universe.

Research Experience
------
- <span style="font-family: Economica; font-size:2em;color:#EC1B26">Probing the Local Environments of Fast Radio Bursts</span>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><em>"A continuous work after the depolarization study"</em> </div><br>
  - Collaborators: **Dongzi Li**, **Fa-yin Wang**, Robert Main<br>
**Abstract**: Conjugate investigation on several repeating FRBs about their depolarization, temporal evolution, and Rotation Measure evolution.<br>
**Conclusion**: _Parsec-scale_ distance between the foreground plasma screen and the FRB source has been revealed, implying that some of the FRBs are consistent with the supernovae explosion scenario while others favor compact interactions in the binary systems.<br>

About Me
------
- I am usually an _ENFP_(now is switched to _ISFP_ sometimes) and always enthusiastic about making friends and getting connections with people.<br>
- I am also a fan of food and music. Not being able to cook makes me a foodie who explores domestic and exotic cuisines. :drooling_face: <br>
- I am also deeply engaged in stand-up comedy shows, being participated in podcast and live performance for dozens of times. <br>
- Now I am a huge fan of Formula 1 (F1), especially for the high-tech equipments!
