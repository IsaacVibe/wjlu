I am a PhD student in the Interstellar Medium and Star formation Group of National Astronomical Observatories of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. 
My research interests include Time-domain Astronomy, Fast Radio Bursts, and pulsars. 
I am also interested in the use of machine learning and data science to improve our understanding of the universe.

Education Experience
------
- **PhD in Astronomy**, National Astronomical Observatories of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, 2023 - Present
- **BSc in Astronomy**, Department of Astronomy and Space Science, Nanjing, China, 2019 - 2023

Research Experience
------
- <span style="font-family: Economica; font-size:2em;color:#EC1B26">Probing the Local Environments of Fast Radio Bursts</span>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><em>"A continuous work after the depolarization study"</em> </div><br>
  **Abstract**: Conjugate investigation on several repeating FRBs about their depolarization, temporal evolution, and Rotation Measure evolution.<br>
  **Conclusion**: _Parsec-scale_ distance between the foreground plasma screen and the FRB source has been revealed, implying that some of the FRBs are consistent with the supernovae explosion scenario while others favor compact interactions in the binary systems.<br>
- <span style="font-family: Economica; font-size:2em;color:#EDAB1F">Temporal Evolution of Depolarization and Magnetic Field of Fast Radio Burst 20201124A</span><br>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><em>"Bachelor Thesis"</em> </div><br>
  **Abstract**: FRB 20201124A was observed to show significant RM variation in several weeks. We figured out the temporal variation of depolarization of FRB 20201124A from FAST observations in 2021. <br>
  **Conclusion**: The quasi-simultaneous variation of depolarization, RM variation, and the line-of-sight magnetic field of FRB 20201124A is consistent with the binary system scenario, which involves active stellar interactions.
