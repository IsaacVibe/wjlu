I signed up to attend the (UAS, [2023年北京大学本科生天文学术研讨会](http://vega.bac.pku.edu.cn/info/1056/2064.htm)) at the first year of my PhD.
At that time, I was just about to finish my very first academic paper based on my bachelor thesis, under the supervision of Prof. Fayin Wang at Nanjing University.
It's pretty lucky that the KIAA hosted UAS after the pandemic, aiming to provide a platform for undergraduate students to present their research and discuss with the faculty and other students, of course, especially the PKU students.
