I signed up to attend the (UAS, [2023年北京大学本科生天文学术研讨会](http://vega.bac.pku.edu.cn/info/1056/2064.htm)) at the first year of my PhD.
At that time, I was just about to finish my very first academic paper based on my bachelor thesis, under the supervision of Prof. Fayin Wang at Nanjing University. <br>
It's pretty lucky that the KIAA hosted UAS after the pandemic, aiming to provide a platform for undergraduate students to present their research and discuss with the faculty and other students, of course, especially the PKU students.
